# Agentic Workflow Engine with NATS.io Inspired by MCP

## Overview

We're proposing to build an agentic workflow engine using NATS.io as the messaging backbone, drawing inspiration from the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This is an excellent approach for creating a distributed, scalable system for autonomous agent coordination.

## Key Components

### 1. NATS.io Foundation

NATS provides the perfect substrate for this with its:
- High-performance messaging
- Pub/Sub and request-reply patterns
- JetStream for persistence
- Clustering capabilities

### 2. MCP-Inspired Architecture

From MCP, we can borrow:
- Context-aware message routing
- Model introspection capabilities
- Dynamic workflow composition
- State management patterns

## Proposed Architecture

```
[Agent Workers] ?? [NATS Core] ?? [Orchestrator]
       ?                   ?               ?
       +-- Workflow State +               +-- Protocol Adapters
```
